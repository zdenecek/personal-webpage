Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a computer science student currently pursuing my computer science degree at [the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en). What you will find here is little outlet of mine for people who want to take a look at some of my work or interests.

Feel free to contact me at [my email address](mailto:zdnek.tomis@gmail.com). Other contact information can be found on the [contacts page](/contacts) section.
