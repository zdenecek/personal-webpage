# Software recommendations

Over the years, I have tried many different software tools. Here is a list of those that I use regularly and that I can recommend.

## [Double Commander](https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/)
Double Commander is a file manager that I use to navigate my files both on Windows and Linux.
I started using it because I got tired of Total Commander, which in its free version requires you to press one of three buttons on application start. Double commander is open source.

## My Firefox setup
Web browser is the most important tool I use and I get to spend most of my time in it. I use Firefox because it is open source and respects my privacy. Here is a list of extensions and tweaks that I use to make my browsing experience better.

### Extensions

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)  
  The best adblocker out there as of right now.
- [The Tree Tab extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/)  
  A tab manager that allows you to organize your tabs into a tree structure. I use it to organize my tabs into groups and subgroups.
- [Tab session manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-session-manager/)  
  A session manager that allows you to save and restore sessions. Useful to separate workspaces.
- [Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/)  
  Adds vim-like keybindings to Firefox. I use it to navigate the web without using the mouse. Although I am not a vim user, I find the keybindings to be quite useful.
- [Video Speed Controller](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/videospeed/)  
  A must have for watching lectures. Allows you to speed up and slow down videos with 0.1 increment, up to infinity.

### User Chrome
User chrome is a way to customize the Firefox UI. I use it to hide the title bar and the tabs because using the Tree Tab extension I have no need for them, furthermore I condensed my bookmarks so that more can fit on the screen. You can find my [userChrome.css file on Github](https://github.com/zdenecek/mozilla_user_chrome)

## [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
Password manager - who could live without one? Bitwarden is a free and open source password manager that I use to store my passwords. It has a nice UI and a browser extension. I use it to store my passwords and other sensitive information. It also has a mobile app, which I use to access my passwords on my phone. Compared to other options, Bitwarden has the most extensive free plan.
