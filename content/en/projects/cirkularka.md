title: Cirkulárka - school magazine 
project_tags: Creative|Typography|CMS
summary: |
    Cirkulárka is a magazine / booklet published at my highschool. In my highschool years, I put a lot of effort into creating it; usually, I was the one to keep pushing and set deadlines so that the team keeps going, and I am proud of the result. 
    Before graduating and eventually leaving the school, I set up a website for the magazine, which is still used today. Some of the articles are available online.
