## Biblioteca - Library Management System

Biblioteca is a web application for managing a library, written for school library at my highschool. Multi-user application with different roles and permissions.

The application is written in PHP using Laravel framework for backend. Aplication is a monolith, some pages use Vue.js, others alpine.js. The application is a multi-page application (MPA) with some SPA elements. The frontend is written in Tailwind CSS.

This was a first web application I have ever written. I have learned a lot about web development during the development of this application and it can be seen in the code sometimes, especially on the frontend part.

Despite this being one of the first web projects, it is a success as it is still deployed and being used by the school library.

Have a look at the deployed application at [knihovna.gsh.cz](https://knihovna.gsh.cz).
