project_tags: XSLT|XML|Python|html/css/js|Tkinter|SQLite|Bridge
summary: |
    Modernization of the HABRA teaching materials, originally written as Word documents. Mixed XML documents allows for conversion into both interactive HTML and PDF for prints and downloads. For the purpose of creating the materials, I have written a GUI with tools to quickly convert bridge deals into XML in Python and Tkinter.
