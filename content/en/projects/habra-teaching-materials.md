summary: |
    Modernization of the HABRA teaching materials, originally written as Word documents. Mixed XML documents allows for conversion into both interactive HTML and PDF for prints and downloads. For the purpose of creating the materials, I have written a GUI with tools to quickly convert bridge deals into XML in Python and Tkinter.

## Bridge Presentations

Bridge presentations is a web application for displaying bridge deals, including cardplay and auction. 


For now, it is intended as a tool to create educational videos by recording the screen while playing a deal. As such, it is optimized for specific browser dimensions and is not usable on other devices.
In the future, the application could be used for any kind of bridge, including live games and educational games or quizzes.


A demo of the application can be found [on my website](http://bp.zdenektomis.eu/). 

Code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/zdenecek/bridge-presentations-web).
