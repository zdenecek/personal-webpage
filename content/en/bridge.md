## Bridge

I am a bridge player. I play bridge since 2014.  
I am a member of the Czech Bridge Federation and the Havířov Bridge Club.   
I am a member of the Czech Bridge U26 National Team.

I am also a bridge tournament director.
I direct tournaments in the Prague Bridge Club. I also direct national tournaments for the Czech Bridge Federation.

What is bridge?  
A card game, a sport. A wonderful leisure and social activity. An enjoyable mental excercise. A way to meet new people and make new friends. [Learn more about bridge here.](https://www.funbridge.com/how-to-play-bridge)

### Bidding systems

- [Fools](https://fools.zdenektomis.eu/)  
   We authored this system with Adam Janas, one of my first serious bridge partners. It is a 2/1 system with transfers
    and some modern gadgets.  
    Nowadays, I play this system with my U26 partner, Adam Pyszko.
