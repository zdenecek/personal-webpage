## About me

I am a computer science student currently pursuing my computer science degree at [the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en). 

My hobbies include programming, playing bridge, reading literature, riding one of my bikes, and spending time with my friends. I am also interested in languages.
